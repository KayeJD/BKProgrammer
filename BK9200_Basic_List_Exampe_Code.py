# This is example code for the BK Precision 9200 Series Power Supplies
# A programming manual for the BK Precision 9200 Series can be found in chapter 5 of:

# Lets make a list
# List mode allows the power supply to store a list, which is a series of up to 150 steps. This list (up to 10) can be stored in the supply's memory. 
# Each step can have it's own voltage, current, and time. The list is traversed when the power supply receives a trigger signal.
# In order to enter list mode you must first enable it. Then you can simply run one of the lists or edit one of them. We will create a simple list now.

# we do this so we don't have to call that constantly. This is unique to a unit and changes depending on USB port used and serial number of a unit. 
# This will automatically detect connected devices and allows you to select the one you want to run the script on.
