Have you ever sat in front of your computer for hours on end working on a side project, on an assignment, or some other work-related task and felt as though you've just been taking blow after blow?

This project is a desktop application that basically gives you a little brain break without losing much time or opportunity for mental stimulation. Run it, play some games, and hopefully you feel good as new for some more productivity :)

It's build using DearpyGui, chosen because of an experience in which I had much, much trouble adapting to this particular framework. 

Simple put, I took it as a challenge.
